# mIoTHub

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This project is designed to be a personal home automation software with the focus on keeping your data locally. The difference with other home control systems (Home Assistant, etc.) lies in the fact that the workflow is managed through node-red, as is the dashboard. You can also control your devices through Alexa.
